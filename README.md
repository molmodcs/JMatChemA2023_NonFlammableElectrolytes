To enhance battery safety, it is of utmost importance to develop non-ﬂammable electrolytes. An emerging concept within this research ﬁeld is the development of localized highly concentrated electrolytes (LHCEs).

In this work, highly concentrated electrolytes (HCE) of 3.0 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in triethyl phosphate (TEP) are diluted by two different hydrofluoroether solvents, bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether (BTFE) and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE). The diluted systems down to 1.5 M are intended to present low viscosity, improved conductivity, and reduced costs. Their solvation structure were analysed by Raman and NMR spectroscopy, and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that a highly concentrated Li+–TEP solvation sheath is formed, which can be protected by the diluents TTE and BTFE. These simulations have also clarified the energetic interaction between the components in the LHCE, which supports the experimental results from the viscosity and the NMR measurements. Non-covalent interactions (NCI) analysis clarified which atoms mainly contribute to the interactions resulting in the observed chemical shifts, and indicated that TTE has a more substantial effect on the solvation structure than BTFE. Other experimental techniques showed that the electrochemical performance of TTE in full-cells and Li-metal cells is higher than the BTFE counterpart. Operando pressure experiments also pointed out the formation of gases in full-cells composed of 1.0 M LiFSI in TEP, which were accompanied by operando XRD.
